# Soar-AoE

This repository is an implementation of a MultiAgent System using Soar: the Cognitive Architecture.

In this work, we aim to model a somewhat feudal society in which we will have a simple hierarchical structure,
composed of a noble or organiser, and minions that obey them. This society tries to mimic, up to a certain point,
the societies that we can build in civilisation evolution strategy video games such as Age of Empires.
