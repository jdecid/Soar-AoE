## Productions for collector agents

## Collector agents can get food/wood
## Collector agents should give up their resources if the lord asks
##   (but will prioritise not dying of starvation)
## Collector agents can get wood by just acting on the environment
## Collector agents can get food by sowing-waiting-harvesting
## Collector agents like to stack up on resources
